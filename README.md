# Notes

- extension .tsx is used for react components
- 2 ways to create a component:

  - function based components
    - concise and easier to write
    - recommended
  - javascript class

- react-dom is the library responsible for updating the dom
  - <React.StrictMode> identifies problems within the react code
- similar to react-dom, another lib react-native is used for mobile devices (i.e. react is not platform dependent)
